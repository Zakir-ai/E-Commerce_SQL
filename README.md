# E-Commerce Sales Analysis using PostgreSQL

## üßæ Project Objective

The objective of this project is to conduct an end-to-end analysis of e-commerce transactional data using SQL in a PostgreSQL environment. This includes cleaning raw sales data, performing exploratory and time-based analysis, identifying business insights, and presenting key performance metrics that can guide strategic decisions in sales, marketing, and customer engagement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) ‚Äì for database creation, querying, and aggregation  
- [**pgAdmin**](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) ‚Äì for managing the PostgreSQL database and importing CSV files
- *(Optional for Visualization)* [**Power BI**](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/downloads/), [**Tableau**](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download), or **Excel** ‚Äì for dashboards and visual reports
- **SQL** ‚Äì for data cleaning, transformation, and complex analysis  
- **CSV File** ‚Äì as the raw transactional data source

## üìÇ Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical transaction records from an online retail store, with the following key fields:

- **Order ID**
- **Product ID**
- **Description**
- **Quantity**
- **Order Date & Time**
- **Unit Price**
- **Customer ID**
- **Country**
- **Amount** *(derived as: quantity √ó unit price)*

## üîÑ Process Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded raw CSV data into PostgreSQL.
- Created a structured table (`cleaned_orders`) with appropriate data types.
- Added a calculated `amount` column.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Removed invalid entries:
  - Negative or zero quantity and price.
  - Cancelled orders (e.g., order IDs starting with 'C').
  - Rows with NULL values in critical fields.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Counted total orders, unique customers, and products.
- Listed unique countries.
- Detected anomalies and missing values.

## üìä Key Analytical Insights

### ‚úÖ Monthly Sales Trend
- Extracted year and month from order dates.
- Aggregated revenue and order count per month.
- Sorted chronologically to reveal trends and seasonality.

### ‚úÖ Top-Selling Products
- Ranked products by units sold and revenue.
- Identified best performers in terms of sales volume and income.

### ‚úÖ Revenue by Country
- Calculated total revenue per country.
- Highlighted top international markets.

### ‚úÖ Loyal Customers
- Aggregated total spend by customer.
- Identified top-spending customers.

### ‚úÖ Time-of-Day Sales Analysis
- Categorized sales into morning, afternoon, evening, and night shifts.
- Revealed customer buying behavior across the day.

### ‚úÖ Monthly Average Order Value (AOV)
- Computed average revenue per order monthly.
- Provided insights into purchasing power and behavior over time.

### ‚úÖ Anomaly Detection
- Flagged transactions with very high quantity for investigation.
- Useful for fraud detection or bulk sale alerts.

## üß† SQL Techniques Applied

- `EXTRACT(MONTH)`, `EXTRACT(YEAR)` for time grouping
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT` for structured insights
- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `COUNT(DISTINCT)`, `AVG()`, `ROUND()`
- Conditional logic using `CASE WHEN` for time shifts
- Full NULL validation and removal during data cleaning

## ‚úÖ Final Outcome

This project provides a clean and scalable SQL-based data pipeline that delivers deep business insights into e-commerce performance. With robust filtering, aggregation, and transformation logic, it supports smarter decision-making in customer engagement, product strategy, and sales optimization.
